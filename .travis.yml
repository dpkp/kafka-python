    - pypy

# TODO: workaround pulled from:
# https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9815#issue-336465122
# It only runs a single 3.7 test job against one version of Kafka but
# that's good enough for now since we test all the other permutations,
# especially since this workaround should be removed in the near future.
# Enable 3.7 without globally enabling sudo and dist: xenial for other build jobs
