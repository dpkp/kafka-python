kafka-python is compatible with (and tested against) broker versions 2.4
through 0.8.0 . kafka-python is not compatible with the 0.8.2-beta release.

Because the kafka server protocol is backwards compatible, kafka-python is
expected to work with newer broker releases as well.

Although kafka-python is tested and expected to work on recent broker versions,
not all features are supported. Specifically, authentication codecs, and
transactional producer/consumer support are not fully implemented. PRs welcome!

kafka-python is tested on python 2.7, 3.4, 3.7, and pypy2.7.

Builds and tests via Travis-CI.  See https://travis-ci.org/dpkp/kafka-python
