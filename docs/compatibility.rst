kafka-python is compatible with (and tested against) broker versions 3.9
through 0.8.0 . kafka-python is not compatible with the 0.8.2-beta release.

Because the kafka server protocol is backwards compatible, kafka-python is
expected to work with newer broker releases as well.

Although kafka-python is tested and expected to work on recent broker versions,
not all features are supported. Specifically, authentication codecs, and
transactional producer/consumer support are not fully implemented. PRs welcome!

kafka-python is tested on python 2.7, and 3.8-3.12.

Builds and tests via Github Actions Workflows.  See https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python/actions
