class StickyPartitionAssignor(AbstractPartitionAssignor):
    """
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-54+-+Sticky+Partition+Assignment+Strategy
    
    The sticky assignor serves two purposes. First, it guarantees an assignment that is as balanced as possible, meaning either:
    - the numbers of topic partitions assigned to consumers differ by at most one; or
    - each consumer that has 2+ fewer topic partitions than some other consumer cannot get any of those topic partitions transferred to it.
    
    Second, it preserved as many existing assignment as possible when a reassignment occurs.
    This helps in saving some of the overhead processing when topic partitions move from one consumer to another.
    
    Starting fresh it would work by distributing the partitions over consumers as evenly as possible.
    Even though this may sound similar to how round robin assignor works, the second example below shows that it is not.
    During a reassignment it would perform the reassignment in such a way that in the new assignment
    - topic partitions are still distributed as evenly as possible, and
    - topic partitions stay with their previously assigned consumers as much as possible.
    
    The first goal above takes precedence over the second one.
    
    Example 1.
    Suppose there are three consumers C0, C1, C2,
    four topics t0, t1, t2, t3, and each topic has 2 partitions,
    resulting in partitions t0p0, t0p1, t1p0, t1p1, t2p0, t2p1, t3p0, t3p1.
    Each consumer is subscribed to all three topics.
    
    The assignment with both sticky and round robin assignors will be:
    - C0: [t0p0, t1p1, t3p0]
    - C1: [t0p1, t2p0, t3p1]
    - C2: [t1p0, t2p1]
    
    Now, let's assume C1 is removed and a reassignment is about to happen. The round robin assignor would produce:
    - C0: [t0p0, t1p0, t2p0, t3p0]
    - C2: [t0p1, t1p1, t2p1, t3p1]
    
    while the sticky assignor would result in:
    - C0 [t0p0, t1p1, t3p0, t2p0]
    - C2 [t1p0, t2p1, t0p1, t3p1]
    preserving all the previous assignments (unlike the round robin assignor).
    
    
    Example 2.
    There are three consumers C0, C1, C2,
    and three topics t0, t1, t2, with 1, 2, and 3 partitions respectively.
    Therefore, the partitions are t0p0, t1p0, t1p1, t2p0, t2p1, t2p2.
    C0 is subscribed to t0;
    C1 is subscribed to t0, t1;
    and C2 is subscribed to t0, t1, t2.
    
    The round robin assignor would come up with the following assignment:
    - C0 [t0p0]
    - C1 [t1p0]
    - C2 [t1p1, t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]
    
    which is not as balanced as the assignment suggested by sticky assignor:
    - C0 [t0p0]
    - C1 [t1p0, t1p1]
    - C2 [t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]
    
    Now, if consumer C0 is removed, these two assignors would produce the following assignments.
    Round Robin (preserves 3 partition assignments):
    - C1 [t0p0, t1p1]
    - C2 [t1p0, t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]
    
    Sticky (preserves 5 partition assignments):
    - C1 [t1p0, t1p1, t0p0]
    - C2 [t2p0, t2p1, t2p2]
