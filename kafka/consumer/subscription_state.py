class SubscriptionState(object):
    """
    A class for tracking the topics, partitions, and offsets for the consumer.
    A partition is "assigned" either directly with assign_from_user() (manual
    assignment) or with assign_from_subscribed() (automatic assignment from
    subscription).

    Once assigned, the partition is not considered "fetchable" until its initial
    position has been set with seek(). Fetchable partitions track a fetch
    position which is used to set the offset of the next fetch, and a consumed
    position which is the last offset that has been returned to the user. You
    can suspend fetching from a partition through pause() without affecting the
    fetched/consumed offsets. The partition will remain unfetchable until the
    resume() is used. You can also query the pause state independently with
    is_paused().

    Note that pause state as well as fetch/consumed positions are not preserved
    when partition assignment is changed whether directly by the user or
    through a group rebalance.

    This class also maintains a cache of the latest commit position for each of
    the assigned partitions. This is updated through committed() and can be used
    to set the initial fetch position (e.g. Fetcher._reset_offset() ).

    A callback interface that the user can implement to trigger custom actions
    when the set of partitions assigned to the consumer changes.

    This is applicable when the consumer is having Kafka auto-manage group
    membership. If the consumer's directly assign partitions, those
    partitions will never be reassigned and this callback is not applicable.

    When Kafka is managing the group membership, a partition re-assignment will
    be triggered any time the members of the group changes or the subscription
    of the members changes. This can occur when processes die, new process
    instances are added or old instances come back to life after failure.
    Rebalances can also be triggered by changes affecting the subscribed
    topics (e.g. when then number of partitions is administratively adjusted).

    There are many uses for this functionality. One common use is saving offsets
    in a custom store. By saving offsets in the on_partitions_revoked(), call we
    can ensure that any time partition assignment changes the offset gets saved.

    Another use is flushing out any kind of cache of intermediate results the
    consumer may be keeping. For example, consider a case where the consumer is
    subscribed to a topic containing user page views, and the goal is to count
    the number of page views per users for each five minute window.  Let's say
    the topic is partitioned by the user id so that all events for a particular
    user will go to a single consumer instance. The consumer can keep in memory
    a running tally of actions per user and only flush these out to a remote
    data store when its cache gets too big. However if a partition is reassigned
    it may want to automatically trigger a flush of this cache, before the new
    owner takes over consumption.

    This callback will execute in the user thread as part of the Consumer.poll()
    whenever partition assignment changes.

    It is guaranteed that all consumer processes will invoke
    on_partitions_revoked() prior to any process invoking
    on_partitions_assigned(). So if offsets or other state is saved in the
    on_partitions_revoked() call, it should be saved by the time the process
    taking over that partition has their on_partitions_assigned() callback
    called to load the state.
